# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Guide

## Before Running npm install - Checklist

### 1. Check if Node.js is Installed

Open Command Prompt and type:
\`\`\`cmd
node --version
\`\`\`

**Expected Result:** Should show something like `v20.11.0` or `v18.17.0`

**If you see:** `'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- **Solution:** Node.js is not installed or not in PATH
- Go to https://nodejs.org and download the LTS version
- Run the installer
- **IMPORTANT:** During installation, make sure "Add to PATH" is checked
- Restart your computer after installation
- Try `node --version` again

### 2. Check if npm is Installed

In Command Prompt, type:
\`\`\`cmd
npm --version
\`\`\`

**Expected Result:** Should show something like `10.2.4` or `9.8.1`

**If you see:** `'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- **Solution:** npm comes with Node.js, so reinstall Node.js
- Make sure to restart your computer after installation

### 3. Check Your Current Directory

In Command Prompt, type:
\`\`\`cmd
cd
\`\`\`

This shows where you are currently located.

**Expected Result:** Should show your project folder path like:
\`\`\`
C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\FinTech.MobileApp
\`\`\`

**If you're in the wrong folder:**
\`\`\`cmd
cd path\to\your\FinTech.MobileApp
\`\`\`

### 4. Verify package.json Exists

In Command Prompt, type:
\`\`\`cmd
dir package.json
\`\`\`

**Expected Result:** Should show the file details

**If you see:** `File Not Found`
- **Solution:** You're in the wrong folder
- Navigate to the correct project folder where package.json exists

\`\`\`

### Error 4: "npm ERR! Unsupported engine"

**What it means:** Your Node.js version is too old or too new

## Clean Install (If Nothing Works)

If you keep getting errors, try a clean install:

### Step 1: Delete node_modules and package-lock.json

\`\`\`cmd
rmdir /s node_modules
del package-lock.json
\`\`\`

Type `Y` when asked to confirm

### Step 2: Clear npm cache

\`\`\`cmd
npm cache clean --force
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Try installing again

\`\`\`cmd
npm install
\`\`\`

## Still Having Issues?

### Check npm logs

After a failed `npm install`, type:
\`\`\`cmd
npm-debug.log
\`\`\`

This will show detailed error information.

### Alternative: Use yarn instead of npm

1. Install yarn globally:
\`\`\`cmd
npm install -g yarn
\`\`\`

2. Then use yarn instead:
\`\`\`cmd
yarn install
yarn dev
\`\`\`

---

## Verify Everything is Working

After successful `npm install`, verify:

### 1. Check if node_modules folder was created
\`\`\`cmd
dir node_modules
\`\`\`

You should see many folders (dependencies)

### 2. Try running the dev server
\`\`\`cmd
npm run dev
\`\`\`

You should see:
\`\`\`
â–² Next.js 14.2.16
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
âœ“ Ready in 2.3s
\`\`\`

### 3. Open browser to localhost:3000

You should see the FinTech splash screen
