## Method 2: I'll Give You All Files

If you can't access GitHub, I can provide you with all the complete file contents here. You would need to:

1. Create the folder structure manually
2. Copy each file content I provide
3. Save them in the correct locations

**Would you like me to provide all the complete files?**

Just say "Yes, give me all files" and I'll provide every single file with complete code that you can copy and paste.
